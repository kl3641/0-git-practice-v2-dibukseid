### AI powered Coding article
[Wired - The AI-powered future of coding is near](https://www.wired.com/ai-powered-coding/)

interesting aritcle that explores how AI-powered coding tools are revolutionizing software dev. It highlights new tools such as SWE-agent
which assist developers in debugging and amending code, making the process entirely more efficient. 
It also discusses the broader implications of AI's rode in coding, and what it means for the evolution of the software engineering role. 
It's interesting to see where AI can go and how it will affect the job market.

I thought this was a rather interesting article as well. To be honest, my personal experience with trying to use AI to help me study has proved pretty futile. I don't think generative AI is quite there yet when it comes to explaining niche and esoteric concepts-- not even to mention that is more often than not liable to be blatantly wrong.
